This app tells you what it is looking at and vibrates based on how confident it is. When using this app you will wave the phone around you until you feel it vibrating more and more which means you are getting closer to an object it understands.
The convolutional neural network inside the app can understand 1000 classes based on ImageNet classes. This app has been tested on the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 phones. Please report issues so I can make a note of them here.
